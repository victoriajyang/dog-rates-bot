Dog-Rates Bot
===================================

This bot is based off of a template for making Twitter bots with [Glitch](https://glitch.com/) and the [Twit](https://github.com/ttezel/twit) node.js library. 

The purpose of this bot is to give an automated rate of a dog and a randomized picture, similar to the @weratedogs twitter.
